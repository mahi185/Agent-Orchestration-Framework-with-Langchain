# Agent-Orchestration-Framework-with-Langchain
“The Agent-Orchestration Framework in LangChain manages how multiple AI agents work together to solve tasks. Each agent has a specific role, and the orchestrator decides the order of actions, shares information, and coordinates tool use. This helps complete complex tasks in a smooth, step-by-step workflow.”
